### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

My name is David Amrani. I've been working in cybersecurity since 2014,
especially in strengthening and **automating cloud security processes**
and continuous integration. I like to make cybersecurity a little bit 
easier and fun for all of us.

I really have a **passion for teaching** and I like to participate in universities,
bootcamps or relaxed talks to bring engineering closer to those who are curious.
I love to chat, feel free to contact me if you feel interested.  

I also like to write on my Medium blog about 
[#Hacking](https://davidmoremad.medium.com/list/hacking-1a6c8e8ee8e8),
[#NewTechnologies](https://medium.com/@davidmoremad/list/new-technologies-484f37bcd41d),
[#CloudSecurity](https://davidmoremad.medium.com/list/cloud-security-bd7fb6a35f82) ...
