### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

Welcome to my space, I hope you find it all neat and tidy.

My name is David Amrani. I have been in cybersecurity since 2014,
especially in strengthening and automating cloud security processes 
and continuous integration. I try to make security a little bit less 
difficult and boring for all of us to work more comfortable.

I really have a passion for teaching and I like to participate in universities,
bootcamps or relaxed talks to bring engineering closer to those who are curious. 
I love to chat, feel free to contact me if you feel interested.
